When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- whenever I don't need the whole repo for my current work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- because I want to decide when to incorporate changes (potentially from other collaborators)
- the changes might interfere with my own changes, leading to merge conflict
