How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- the staging area is an intermediate place between working dir and repo 
- the staging area lets me add different files from my working dir to the repo
- therefore it gives me more control over commmits

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- by adding only one logical change to the staging area

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
