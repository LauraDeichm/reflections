What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- a git repo is created, but nothing is committed yet

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- the staging area is an intermediate place between working dir and repo 
- the staging area lets me add different files from my working dir to the repo
- therefore it gives me more control over commmits
